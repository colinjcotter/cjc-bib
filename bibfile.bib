   keywords={paradiag, pint}
%Paradiag for time collocation methods (these produce implicit
%one-step Runge-Kutta methods). This involves using Paradiag to
%produce timestep blocks, which are further diagonalised by
%eigenvalue decomposition.  Adaptive selection of alpha on each
%Picard iteration, based on trading off error between the
%alpha-circulant approximation of the original system (goes down
%for small alpha) and the round-off/truncation error in solving
%the alpha-circulant system (goes down for large alpha). This can
%be done with an increasing sequence of alpha values towards 1,
%they provide a formula

  title={Stability implies robust convergence of a class of diagonalization-based iterative algorithms},
  author={Wu, Shulin and Zhou, Tao and Zhou, Zhi},
  journal={arXiv e-prints},
  pages={arXiv--2102 },
  year={2021},
  keywords={paradiag, pint}
%They prove that in a paradiag iteration, i.e.  doing a
%fixed point iteration approximating the all-at-once system by
%the alpha-circulant one (for linear, constant coefficients),
%the error reduction rate is bounded from above by
%alpha/(1-alpha) for any stable one-step method. All comes down
%to some linear algebra

  volume={19},
  pages={75--83},
  year={2018},
  keywords={SDC, pint},
  publisher={Springer}
%they provide parallel across the method SDC, by writing SDC as
%fixed point iterations approximating (I-dt*Q*F)u = b.
%Block Gauss-Seidel gives backward Euler SDC.
%they look at diagonal approximations, and diagonalisation.
