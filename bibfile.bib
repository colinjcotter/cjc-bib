  title={A parallel implementation of a diagonalization-based parallel-in-time integrator},
  author={Caklovic, Gayatri and Speck, Robert and Frank, Martin},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.12571},
  year={2021},
  note = 	 {Paradiag for time collocation methods (these
                  produce implicit one-step Runge-Kutta methods). This
                  involves using Paradiag to produce timestep blocks,
                  which are further diagonalised by eigenvalue
                  decomposition.
		  Adaptive selection of alpha on each Picard iteration,
		  based on trading off error between the alpha-circulant
		  approximation of the original system (goes down for
		  small alpha) and the round-off/truncation error in
		  solving the alpha-circulant system (goes down for large
		  alpha). This can be done with an increasing sequence
		  of alpha values towards 1, they provide a formula.}

@article{wu2021stability,
  title={Stability implies robust convergence of a class of diagonalization-based iterative algorithms},
  author={Wu, Shulin and Zhou, Tao and Zhou, Zhi},
  journal={arXiv e-prints},
  pages={arXiv--2102 },
  year={2021},
  note =            {They prove that in a paradiag iteration, i.e.
   doing a fixed point iteration approximating the all-at-once system
   by the alpha-circulant one (for linear, constant coefficients), the
   error reduction rate is bounded from above by alpha/(1-alpha) for
   any stable one-step method. All comes down to some linear algebra.}
