%Paradiag for time collocation methods (these produce implicit
%one-step Runge-Kutta methods). This involves using Paradiag to
%produce timestep blocks, which are further diagonalised by
%eigenvalue decomposition.  Adaptive selection of alpha on each
%Picard iteration, based on trading off error between the
%alpha-circulant approximation of the original system (goes down
%for small alpha) and the round-off/truncation error in solving
%the alpha-circulant system (goes down for large alpha). This can
%be done with an increasing sequence of alpha values towards 1,
%they provide a formula

  keywords={paradiag, pint}
%They prove that in a paradiag iteration, i.e.  doing a
%fixed point iteration approximating the all-at-once system by
%the alpha-circulant one (for linear, constant coefficients),
%the error reduction rate is bounded from above by
%alpha/(1-alpha) for any stable one-step method. All comes down
%to some linear algebra
